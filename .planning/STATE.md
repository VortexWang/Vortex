# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-11-03)

**Core value:** 在租户隔离、额度与租约安全边界内可靠转发 TCP / UDP 业务流量，并在正常运行及故障恢复中保持计量可信、权利不重复签发、未知负债不被无资金释放。
**Current focus:** Phase 05 — M3 节点 Agent 与 Edge Hub (M3 Agent and Hub)

## Current Position

Phase: 5 — M3 节点 Agent 与 Edge Hub (M3 Agent and Hub)
Current Plan: Phase 5 discussion pending
Total Plans in Phase: TBD
Status: Planning
Last activity: 2026-11-05 — Phase 4 implementation closed by owner decision; qualification gaps carried forward

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- V1.11 is a product reference, not a frozen acceptance baseline; current owner decisions govern.
- The user approved Vegeta in place of k6; CR-001 records the tooling and acceptance impact without altering the frozen source.
- The roadmap follows engineering prerequisites, then M0 through M6 in order; dependencies are reviewed just before the phase that introduces them.
- NFR-038 historical recovery is out of scope after project restart. The eleven original register rows remain `missing`; this is not a claim of recovery or verification.
- PostgreSQL and Valkey are external data services. Their image package licenses are excluded from the product dependency gate; versions, provenance, and image digests remain tracked.
- OrbStack is running; local Compose and Phase 4 Docker protocol checks passed on b71a9d0. `gh auth status` confirms VortexWang is the active GitHub account with repo/workflow scopes. Prior same-commit Actions evidence exists for Phase 1; current governance changes still need CI evidence.

### Pending Todos

- Phase 4 implementation gap plans are executed. Keep NFR-003/005/006/007/039/040/044 and D-04 open until eligible native qualification and complete authority evidence exist; durable production authorization/accounting remains a later Agent/Hub integration concern. This is carried forward while Phase 5 proceeds.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 restart implementation runs the five-process three-relay topology and now passes finite authorized-route/recovery regressions; this does not establish performance qualification.
- Plan 04-06 same-load independent TLS diagnostics exceeded 70%, but formal gates remain open. The scale-test accounting discrepancy was caused by incomplete JSONL output at Docker shutdown; relay stop grace and exit-status checks now protect the evidence. Chunked event storage removes large append copies. Clean baa0a02 local Docker and Actions passed 16-stream/60-second accounting regressions with zero loss; Actions generated only 24.21 Mbps actual UDP, so 100 Mbps dedicated-host qualification remains pending. D-04 has now received a candidate review, but parameter experiments and lock approval remain pending. No Phase 4 completion is claimed.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-11-05T00:00:00.000000+00:00
Stopped at: Phase 4 implementation closed by owner decision; ready for Phase 5 discussion. Formal NFRs/D-04 remain unqualified.
Resume file: None

### Latest qualification review

D-04 review completed, candidates not locked. Standard performance workload still has no production authorization
Gate; optional finite source credit is separate from the memory event recorder; NFR-039/040/044 runtime behavior
and NFR-007 early TCP DATA remain missing. These gaps are actionable without
exclusive performance hardware. Updated 04-VERIFICATION.md points to the exact
matrix; diagnostic numeric improvements do not mark formal NFRs passed.


### Prior source credit slice — 6a1faf2

At 6a1faf2 source authorization was opt-in for static-snapshot TCP only; finite balance,
blocks and local replenishment/exhaustion are verified on Docker/native. UDP,
hot routes, dynamic snapshot/grant and real issuer outcomes remain excluded.
The standard performance workload still lacks full authorization integration.
See 04-06-CREDIT-EVIDENCE.md; D-04 remains candidate and Phase 4 executing.


### Grant and UDP increment

Clean d2f21f8 Docker/native verified static-snapshot TCP/UDP credit and bounded
trusted grant-result injection. Earlier TCP-only/UDP-exclusion notes are now
historical. Hot routes/multiple snapshots, remote/persistent issuer, policy
clock/share integration and formal performance qualifications remain open.
Actions 41856742608 passed all steps on that clean SHA; extracted credit
JSON and semantic hashes match Docker/native.
